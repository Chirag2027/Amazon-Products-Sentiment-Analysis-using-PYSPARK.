# Amazon-Products-Sentiment-Analysis-using-PYSPARK.

# Introduction
Dissecting client input is fundamental within the age of e-commerce in arrange to way better get it customer temperament, make strides client involvement, and upgrade item offerings. Utilizing the endless dataset from the All_Beauty.json collection, which incorporates in-depth assessments and evaluations of magnificence products on Amazon.

This project's objective is to utilize advanced information handling and machine learning methods in PySpark, a distributed computing system, to classify client sentiments based on their printed assessments and related evaluations. The program proficiently handles enormous datasets and makes solid machine learning pipelines for opinion categorization by utilizing PySpark's versatility and proficiency.

# Objectives
- To gain insight into consumer opinions via text reviews, which will help e-commerce sites pinpoint patterns, advantages, and opportunities for product enhancement.

- To illustrate the control of PySpark in dealing with and preparing huge-scale datasets productively for assumption examination assignments.

- To assess and contrast how well different machine learning algorithms predict customer sentiment to determine which model works best.

- To investigate how natural language processing methods, like TF-IDF, Stop Words and HashingTF, improve machine learning model's predictive power.
